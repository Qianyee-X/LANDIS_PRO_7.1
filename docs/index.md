LANDIS PRO is a raster-based forest landscape model (FLM) that evolved over 15 years of development and applications of the LANDIS model ([Mladenoff et al. 1996](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/GIS+and+Environmental+Modeling%3A+Progress+and+Research+Issues-p-9780470236772), [He and Mladenoff 1999](https://doi.org/10.1007/s100219900), [Mladenoff 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.03.016)). Within each raster cell, the model records number of trees by species age cohort (Fig. 1), and size (e.g., DBH) of each age cohort, which is derived from empirical age-DBH relationships. LANDIS PRO incorporates species-, stand-, and landscape-scale processes (Fig. 1). Species- and stand-scale processes are simulated within each cell, and landscape-scale processes are simulated across the whole landscape, in addition these three scales interact with each other.
